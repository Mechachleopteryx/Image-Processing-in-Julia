# Digital-Image-Processing-Gonzalez
Codes for most examples in the famous textbook Digital Image Processing (Gonzalez) [3rd Edition [Amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Image-Processing-Rafael-Gonzalez/dp/013168728X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1535526723&sr=8-2&keywords=digital+image+processing). I hope this can help you understand the mentioned concepts better.

!!! warning

I stopped contributing new demos to this repo because I put most of my free time developing JuliaImages, and because I'm trying to find a way to write a good quality demos (CI support, source control, good looking). I'll eventually come back to this repo when most image processing tasks are covered by JuliaImages. ETA -- early 2020

## Usage
* For Julia: running the `ipynb` file in jupyter notebook and see what happens. The `ipynb` files contain results for convenience and `jl` files are used to track differences. Check [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) for installation and usage.
* For Python: same as Julia. `py` files are used to track differences.
* For MATLAB: since MATLAB live script runs very slow at present, `m` file is provided without results.

Explanations and additional codes are added to these examples for better understanding.

## Contribution:

### Issue
For example you don't understand and want codes *immediately*, you could create an issue

### Pull request
* Open *one* pull request(PR) for each single example, so that I can review it easier
* Each PR should contain your codes and data(if not exists), and modify corresponding part of this `README.md`
* For codes written in `ipynb` 
	* you should contain the corresponding `py` or `jl` files for easy diff tracking. Make sure `py` and `ipynb` contains the same codes.
	* make sure to `restart kernel and run all cells` to keep your results for connivence
	* make sure to delete unnecessary empty cells, e.g., the last one
